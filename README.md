# Paramecium
Here is the repository for my final project for CS-4423-Game Development

Paramecium is a top down 2D adventure game with linear stage progression based 
around problem-solving and survival. The player takes control of a small single-celled 
protist in a research facility which navigates their way through an environment filled with
predators and hazardsâ€”all of which can destroy the player quickly. All of this takes 
place from the perspective of a curious microbial researcher looking down via 
microscope.
